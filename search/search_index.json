Instead, a specific solver must be chosen for a class of problems to solve. Each solver has a unique and descriptive name. For some, namely incompressible solvers, it reflects the algorithm, eg. <code>simpleFoam</code> uses the SIMPLE algorithm, <code>pimpleFoam</code> uses the PIMPLE algorithm. More often the name reflects the physical models or type of problem it is designed to solve, eg. <code>icoFoam</code>, <code>simpleFoam</code>, <code>sonicFoam</code>. A list of all current solvers is available here.  <p>Solvers that come packaged with OpenFOAM are in the <code>$FOAM_SOLVERS</code> directory, quickly accessed by typing <code>app</code> at the command line. This directory is subdivided into several directories categorized by continuum mechanics.</p> <p>Utilities are designed to perform tasks involving data manipulation. Once again, the names are descriptive. And a list of all current utilities is available here.</p> <p>Utilities that come packaged with OpenFOAM are in the <code>$FOAM_SUTILITIES</code> directory, quickly accessed by typing <code>util</code> at the command line.
